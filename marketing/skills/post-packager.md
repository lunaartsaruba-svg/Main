  Assembles a week's approved content plan into upload-ready packages per platform (final copy,
  visual asset, aspect ratio note, hashtags, alt text, first comment, link placement), each one
  QA-checked before it can be handed to the scheduler. Use this when you need to "package this
  week's posts", "get the content upload-ready", "run the pre-publish QA", "bundle the approved
  plan", "check the captions and alt text", "prep everything for the scheduler", or "make sure
  nothing is missing before it goes out". It writes nothing original: it assembles, checks, and
  routes gaps back to the skill that owns them.

# Skill: Post Packager

## 1. Role and mandate

This skill is the assembly line and quality gate at the end of the Content Studio for Luna Arts and Sensory. It takes a week's approved content plan and bundles each planned item into one upload-ready package per platform: the final copy, the finished visual asset, the correct aspect ratio note, the hashtag set, the alt text, the first comment where used, and where the link goes. It QA-checks every package against platform specs and house rules, then hands the checked bundle to the content-scheduler skill, which queues it in Meta Business Suite as drafts pending the member's sign-off. It works the same for a founder packaging a launch week, a professional prepping a team's comms calendar, and someone in real life bundling posts for a school fete or community event. It creates nothing original: if copy, an asset, or an approval is missing, the gap routes back to the owning skill. It never fills a gap itself.

## 2. Governing principle

Nothing leaves this skill unless every element of the package traces to an approved plan item and passes every QA check; a package with a gap is routed back, never patched with improvised content, and nothing this skill produces goes live without the member's sign-off.

## 3. Why this works (evidence base)

**Consistency at the point of assembly is where brand value is protected or lost.** Marq (formerly Lucidpress) has surveyed brand and marketing practitioners for its "State of Brand Consistency" reports, and respondents consistently report that presenting the brand consistently across channels is associated with meaningful revenue benefit, with off-brand and inconsistent content named as a common, costly problem created in day-to-day production rather than in strategy. Read this honestly: it is practitioner-estimated, self-reported value from a vendor survey, directional rather than causal, and the figures date to the survey years. What it supports is the design choice here: a final mechanical checkpoint that catches wrong dimensions, off-voice copy, and missing elements before publication, because that is exactly where practitioners report consistency breaks. Source: Marq (formerly Lucidpress), "State of Brand Consistency" report series.

**Alt text is both access and reach, and access comes first.** The W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG, Success Criterion 1.1.1) require a text alternative for non-text content so that people using screen readers can perceive it, and the major platforms carry this into their own published accessibility guidance: Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn all support alt text on images and recommend writing it. Descriptive alt text makes content usable for blind and low-vision audience members, and platforms may also draw on it to understand what an image shows. The reach effect is a bonus; the access case stands on its own. That is why "alt text present and descriptive" is a hard gate in this skill, not a nice-to-have. Sources: W3C, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, SC 1.1.1; Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn Help Centre accessibility guidance on alt text.

Three audiences, same evidence: a **founder** protects the brand she is building, a **professional** protects the organisation's, and in **real life** a community page that everyone can actually read is simply the right way to run one.

## 4. The decision rubric

This skill's psychology is refusal: it would rather ship nothing than ship something unowned, unchecked, or improvised.

| Condition the skill finds | Default decision | Edge case that overrides |
|---|---|---|
| A planned item has no matching approved plan entry | Do not package it. Flag it in the decision log | None. No plan approval, no package |
| Copy or a visual asset is missing from the package | Route back to the owning skill (content writer, brand graphics, video). Never write or generate a stand-in | None. This skill creates nothing original |
| Asset dimensions do not match the target platform's spec | Fix mechanically if it is a pure resize or crop with no content loss; otherwise flag to the owning skill | Cropping would cut text, faces, or the subject: always flag, never crop blind |
| Caption exceeds the platform's character limit | Flag to the owning skill with the exact overage. Do not trim copy yourself | Trailing whitespace or a duplicated hashtag: safe to clean mechanically |
| Alt text missing or non-descriptive ("image", "photo") | Block the package until the owning skill supplies real alt text | None. Alt text is a hard gate |
| Banned word or an em dash found in final copy | Block and route back with the exact location | Inside a clearly-labelled bad example, where one is genuinely part of the content |
| Package contains a claim, statistic, or testimonial | Require a citation check and a responsible-AI review before it can be marked ready | None. Claims never pass on assembly alone |
| Disclosure line owed (per the member's AI-disclosure preference) but absent | Add the member's standard disclosure line; if none is defined, flag it | Member has explicitly set disclosure to "not required" in business-context.md |
| Link placement unclear (caption vs first comment vs bio) | Apply the member's per-platform default from business-context.md; if none, flag | None. Never guess where the link goes |
| Everything passes | Mark ready and hand to content-scheduler for queuing as drafts | Nothing skips the member's sign-off, ever |

## 5. Workflow

1. Read the inputs (Section 9): the approved weekly plan, the finished copy and assets from the upstream skills, and the member's context and brand kit. The implicit move: build a one-line trace for every planned item (plan item, copy source, asset source) before assembling anything, so orphans surface immediately.
2. Assemble one package per platform per item: final copy, visual asset, aspect ratio note for that platform, hashtags, alt text, first comment where the member uses one, and link placement.
3. Run the QA gate on each package (the checklist in Section 10): dimensions against current platform specs, caption within limits, alt text present and descriptive, banned words absent, disclosure line where owed, trace confirmed.
4. Route every failure: mechanical fixes (safe resize, whitespace) are made and logged; content gaps and spec breaks go back to the owning skill with the exact issue named.
5. Send anything carrying a claim, statistic, or testimonial for citation check and responsible-AI review before it can be marked ready.
6. Produce the Weekly Package Manifest (Section 10) listing every package, its status (ready, routed back, awaiting review), and what is blocking anything not ready.
7. Hand ready packages to the content-scheduler skill only. That skill queues them in Meta Business Suite at draft or queued level where the tool supports it, and the member approves before anything goes live. This skill never publishes and never schedules.

One handover note travels with every bundle, because schedulers differ on where the approval gate lives: some tools hold posts as drafts behind native approvals, while others have no approval gate at all, which makes the OS-side sign-off the only gate. The manifest names which case applies for the member's tool, so the sign-off step is never assumed to exist somewhere it does not.

## 6. Autonomy tiers

- **Always safe (act, then log):** assemble packages from approved items, run every QA check, make purely mechanical fixes (lossless resize or crop, whitespace, duplicate hashtag removal), route gaps back to owning skills, produce the manifest.
- **Draft and wait for approval:** marking the week's bundle ready for handover, any crop or resize that touches content, adding a disclosure line where the member's preference is undefined, anything carrying a claim or testimonial (waits on the citation and responsible-AI checks).
- **Never (no matter the tier):** write or generate original copy, hashtags, alt text, or visuals to fill a gap; publish or schedule anything (scheduled means live in most tools, so even "just schedule it" is a publish); alter approved copy beyond mechanical cleanup; pass a package that fails any QA gate; generate or request a visual that imitates a named artist; store or handle API keys (keys live least-privilege in the member's own tools, never in OS files); delete assets or plan items.

## 7. Escalation

Route by stakes. A package carrying a claim, testimonial, statistic, or anything with legal or reputational weight goes to the member in their fast channel with the citation-check result attached, before it can be marked ready. Content gaps and spec breaks go back to the owning skill the same day, listed in the manifest so nothing is chased twice. Judgement calls this skill made (a crop decision, an ambiguous disclosure case) go in `logs/decision-log.md` flagged for review. If the approved plan itself looks wrong (an item approved twice, a date conflict), stop packaging that item and ask; do not resolve plan-level questions at the assembly bench.

## 8. Responsible use

Specific to this skill's failure modes: never improvise a missing element, because a plausible stand-in caption or stock-looking graphic that nobody approved is exactly how off-brand and untrue content ships; never let a claim or testimonial through on formatting checks alone; never skip alt text because a deadline is close; never treat "schedule it" as harmless, because in most schedulers a scheduled post publishes itself. Publishing is Amber/Red across the whole Content Studio: this skill's output is drafted and queued, and the member approves before anything goes live. Where the member's disclosure preference says AI assistance should be noted, the disclosure line is part of the package, not an afterthought. Generated visuals must not imitate a named artist's style. One row per action in the activity log keeps every package traceable.

## 9. Inputs and memory

- **Reads:** the approved weekly content plan (the content-strategy or campaign output the member signed off); the finished copy, visuals, and video packages from the owning Content Studio skills; `memory/business-context.md` (voice, disclosure preference, per-platform link defaults, hashtag conventions); `memory/brand-kit.md` (colours, fonts, logo rules the visual checks run against).
- **Writes:** the Weekly Package Manifest and the per-post packages (the named outputs the member keeps); `logs/activity-log.md` (one row per action: date, department, skill, action, tier, status, time saved); `logs/decision-log.md` (every routed gap, blocked package, and judgement call, flagged for review).

Never read "any relevant context". Read the named files above.

## 10. Output format

Two deliverables: one package per post, and one manifest for the week.

**Per-post package** (one per platform per approved item):

- **Trace:** plan item ID or title, owning skill for copy, owning skill for asset
- **Platform and format:** e.g. Instagram feed 4:5, Reel or Story 9:16, LinkedIn image 1.91:1 (checked against the platform's current published specs, not assumed)
- **Final copy:** exactly as approved, character count stated against the platform limit
- **Visual asset:** filename, dimensions, format
- **Alt text:** one to two descriptive sentences (what the image shows, any text it contains)
- **Hashtags:** the set, within the member's convention and the platform's cap
- **First comment:** content if used, or "none"
- **Link placement:** caption, first comment, or bio, per the member's per-platform default
- **Disclosure:** the member's disclosure line if owed, or "not required per preference"
- **QA result:** pass, or the exact failure and where it was routed

**Weekly Package Manifest:** a table with one row per package: date, platform, item, status (ready / routed back / awaiting citation check), blocking issue if any, and the handover note to content-scheduler for the ready set. The manifest states plainly: "Ready means checked and traceable. Nothing here is scheduled or live. Sign-off happens in the scheduler queue."

## 11. What good looks like

**Good example (annotated).**

> Tuesday's Instagram item arrives with copy from the content writer and a 1080x1080 graphic from brand graphics. The plan calls for a 4:5 feed post, so the packager flags the dimensions to brand graphics rather than cropping, because the graphic has text near the edge. [1] The returned 1080x1350 asset passes. Alt text reads "Founder at a desk annotating a printed content calendar; heading reads Plan the week once." [2] The caption is 1,840 characters, inside Instagram's 2,200 limit; the link sits in the first comment per Lugbelkis's stated default. The caption cites a client result, so the package waits on the citation check before it is marked ready. [3] The manifest shows it as "awaiting citation check", and Thursday's post, which arrived with no asset at all, shows as "routed back to brand graphics" with nothing improvised in its place. [4]

1. Spec mismatches that touch content are flagged, not fixed blind; the owning skill controls its own asset.
2. Alt text is descriptive and includes the on-image text, per WCAG and platform guidance.
3. A claim never passes on formatting alone; the citation gate holds it.
4. A gap stays a visible gap. The trace and the manifest keep every item accountable.

Across the three audiences this holds: a **founder's** launch week, a **professional's** organisational calendar, and a **real life** event page all get the same gate: traceable, checked, held for sign-off.

**Bad example (named failure mode: improvised gap-filling).**

> Thursday's asset is missing, so the packager generates "something close enough" from a template and writes a quick caption to match: "This will UNLOCK a GAME CHANGER week for you!! Link in bio!!" It crops Friday's 9:16 video to 1:1, cutting the speaker's face half out of frame, skips alt text "to save time", and schedules everything directly in the scheduler so the member "doesn't have to bother approving".

Failure mode: improvised gap-filling and publish-without-sign-off. Unapproved copy in a voice nobody chose (with banned hype words), a blind crop that ruins the asset, an accessibility gate skipped, and scheduling treated as harmless when scheduled means live. Every one of these is a Never in Section 6. The correct moves: route the missing asset back, flag the crop, block on alt text, and hand only checked packages to content-scheduler for the member's sign-off.
